At first, view the <a href="/how-to-write-/NO-WAR/">webpage</a> in this repository.

This page explains how to write "NO WAR" in various languages.

__The goal of this project is ANYONE who references this webpage will be able to write the word that means "NO WAR" in any language around the world.__

I will add languages to the webpage little by little.

But my language ability is too poor to complete this project...

__Please teach me how to write "NO WAR" in not yet added country languages in this project.__

Please send me infos below. (In order to my language ability, please use only English or Japanese)

* The country and Language
* The word means "NO WAR"
* If possible, stroke orders of the word

## About developer

I am a indie game developer in japan. I'm living in far from Ukraine, but so worried about people in the battlefield.

## Abount the index.html

The webpage is built using Unity (Game Engine) with "Handwriter", the Editor Asset to reproduce strokes in characters.

(This asset is my asset and I publish this by myself on Unity Asset Store.)
